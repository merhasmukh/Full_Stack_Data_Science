For example, what's it about? What does the words mean in the context? Who is doing what to whom? What products and compnaies are mentioned in the text? Which texts are simmilar to each other.\n","\n","spaCy is designed specifically for **production use** and helps you build applications that process and \"understand\" large volume of text. It can be used to build **information extraction** or **natural language processing** systems, or to pre-process text for **deep learning**.\n","\n","\n","## What spaCy isn't?\n","\n","- First, **spaCy** isn't a platform or an \"API\". Unlike a platform, spaCy doesn't provide a software as a service or a web application. It’s an open-source library designed to help you build NLP applications, not a consumable service.\n","\n","- Second, **spaCy is not an out-of-the-box chat bot engine.** While spaCy can be used to power conversational applications, it’s not designed specifically for chat bots, and only provides the underlying text processing capabilities.\n","\n","- Third, **spaCy is not research software.** It’s built on the latest research, but it’s designed to get things done. This leads to fairly different design decisions than NLTK or CoreNLP, which were created as platforms for teaching and research. The main difference is that spaCy is integrated and opinionated. spaCy tries to avoid asking the user to choose between multiple algorithms that deliver equivalent functionality. Keeping the menu small lets spaCy deliver generally better performance and developer experience.\n","\n","- Fourth, **spaCy is not a company** It’s an open-source library.The company publishing spaCy and other software is called Explosion AI.\n","\n","## Installation\n","\n","spaCy is compatible with **64bit of Cython 2.7/3.5+** and runs on **Unix/Linux**, **macOS/OS X** and **Windows**. The latest version of spaCy is available over pip and conda.\n","\n"," --> Installation with pip in Linux,Windows and macOs/OS X for both version of Python 2.7/3.5+\n"," \n","     pip install -U spacy or pip install spacy\n","     \n"," --> Installation with conda in Linux,Windows and macOs/OS X for both version of Python 2.7/3.5+\n"," \n","     conda install -c conda-forge spacy\n","\n","\n","\n","  Once you’ve [downloaded and installed](https://spacy.io/usage/models) a model, you can load it via spacy.load() This will return a *Language* object containing all components and data needed to process text.
