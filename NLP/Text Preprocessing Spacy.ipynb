For example, what's it about? What does the words mean in the context? Who is doing what to whom? What products and compnaies are mentioned in the text? Which texts are simmilar to each other.\n","\n","spaCy is designed specifically for **production use** and helps you build applications that process and \"understand\" large volume of text. It can be used to build **information extraction** or **natural language processing** systems, or to pre-process text for **deep learning**.\n","\n","\n","## What spaCy isn't?\n","\n","- First, **spaCy** isn't a platform or an \"API\". Unlike a platform, spaCy doesn't provide a software as a service or a web application. It’s an open-source library designed to help you build NLP applications, not a consumable service.\n","\n","- Second, **spaCy is not an out-of-the-box chat bot engine.** While spaCy can be used to power conversational applications, it’s not designed specifically for chat bots, and only provides the underlying text processing capabilities.\n","\n","- Third, **spaCy is not research software.** It’s built on the latest research, but it’s designed to get things done. This leads to fairly different design decisions than NLTK or CoreNLP, which were created as platforms for teaching and research. The main difference is that spaCy is integrated and opinionated. spaCy tries to avoid asking the user to choose between multiple algorithms that deliver equivalent functionality. Keeping the menu small lets spaCy deliver generally better performance and developer experience.\n","\n","- Fourth, **spaCy is not a company** It’s an open-source library.The company publishing spaCy and other software is called Explosion AI.\n","\n","## Installation\n","\n","spaCy is compatible with **64bit of Cython 2.7/3.5+** and runs on **Unix/Linux**, **macOS/OS X** and **Windows**. The latest version of spaCy is available over pip and conda.\n","\n"," --> Installation with pip in Linux,Windows and macOs/OS X for both version of Python 2.7/3.5+\n"," \n","     pip install -U spacy or pip install spacy\n","     \n"," --> Installation with conda in Linux,Windows and macOs/OS X for both version of Python 2.7/3.5+\n"," \n","     conda install -c conda-forge spacy\n","\n","\n","\n","  Once you’ve [downloaded and installed](https://spacy.io/usage/models) a model, you can load it via spacy.load() This will return a *Language* object containing all components and data needed to process text. We usually call it *nlp* object on a string of text will return a processed *Doc*

“lion”, “bear”, “apple” and \"banana\" are all pretty common in English, so they’re part of the model’s vocabulary, and come with a vector. The word “fadsfdshds” on the other hand is a lot less common and out-of-vocabulary – so its vector representation consists of 300 dimensions of 0, which means it’s practically nonexistent. If your application will benefit from a large vocabulary with more vectors, you should consider using one of the larger models or loading in a full vector package, for example, *en_vectors_web_lg*, which includes over 1 million unique vectors.\n","\n","spaCy is able to compare two objects, and make a prediction of how similar they are. Predicting similarity is useful for building recommendation systems or flagging duplicates. For example, you can suggest a user content that’s similar to what they’re currently looking at, or label a support ticket as a duplicate if it’s very similar to an already existing one.\n","\n","Each Doc, Span and Token comes with a .similarity() method that lets you compare it with another object, and determine the similarity. Of course similarity is always subjective – whether “dog” and “cat” are similar really depends on how you’re looking at it. spaCy’s similarity model usually assumes a pretty general-purpose definition of similarity."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":24,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["lion lion 1.0\n","lion bear 0.40031397342681885\n","lion cow 0.4524093568325043\n","lion apple 0.06742796301841736\n","lion mango 0.18510109186172485\n","lion spinach 0.06951921433210373\n","bear lion 0.40031397342681885\n","bear bear 1.0\n","bear cow 0.2781473994255066\n","bear apple 0.18584339320659637\n","bear mango 0.14443379640579224\n","bear spinach 0.0758492723107338\n","cow lion 0.4524093568325043\n","cow bear 0.2781473994255066\n","cow cow 1.0\n","cow apple 0.25756582617759705\n","cow mango 0.26287969946861267\n","cow spinach 0.261837899684906\n","apple lion 0.06742796301841736\n","apple bear 0.18584339320659637\n","apple cow 0.25756582617759705\n","apple apple 1.0\n","apple mango 0.6305076479911804\n","apple spinach 0.5129707455635071\n","mango lion 0.18510109186172485\n","mango bear 0.14443379640579224\n","mango cow 0.26287969946861267\n","mango apple 0.6305076479911804\n","mango mango 1.0\n","mango spinach 0.5483009219169617\n","spinach lion 0.06951921433210373\n","spinach bear 0.0758492723107338\n","spinach cow 0.261837899684906\n","spinach apple 0.5129707455635071\n","spinach mango 0.5483009219169617\n","spinach spinach 1.0\n"]}],"source":["import spacy\n","\n","nlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_md\")  # make sure to use larger model!\n","tokens = nlp(\"lion bear cow apple mango spinach\")\n","\n","for token11 in tokens:\n","    for token13 in tokens:\n","        print(token11.text, token13.text, token11.similarity(token13))"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["In the above case you can see that \"lion\" and \"bear\" have a similarity of 63%.
